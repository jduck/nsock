05/26/2004 	jjd	- broke off nsock_unix_resolve()
			- changed io_pipe to use nsock_t structs or
			  supplied integer socket descriptors

05/24/2004 	jjd 	- restructured the API to use the nsock_t
			  structure for all calls (this structure now
			  contains the socket descriptor)
			- created nsock_accept
			
05/23/2004 	jjd	- added SSL support for connect/accept
			- added a state flag to keep better tabs on
			  the progress of use of the socket
			- made code more modularized so it could be
			  called in ways closer to the orignal calls
			- added reverse resolution via nsock_resolve_rev()
			- renamed nsock_resolve() to nsock_resolve_fwd()

			- fixed nsock_resolve() to allow resolution of
			  INADDR_ANY:ANY

			  to find out what the port really is
			- changed tcp connect/listen calls to return
			  negative values when there is a problem
			  (instead of 0 for undefined error)
			- allow 0 port passed to nsock_host()

			  nsock_unix_init_connect()

10/02/2002	jjd	- fixed a minor bug in nsock_tcp_free where it
			  could possibly have dereferenced a null
			  pointer
			- added possible error checking to
			  nsock_tcp_connected()

04/08/2002 	jjd 	- merged nsock_get_error into nsock_error for
			  greater efficiency and removed the old
			  function

			- created nsock_tcp_init_connect and

			- created nsock_tcp_host to put the hostname
			  and port number into the correct format..
			- switched checks for AF_UNSPEC to !AF_INET
			- fixed a bug where the alarm timeout was not
			  reset after a connect failure..

03/20/2002 	jjd 	- changed version to 0.8.3
			- finished renaming to nsock_* 

02/20/2002	jjd	- changed version to 0.8.2.5
			- created get*Err functions for programs that
			  which to format their own errors..
			- switched from string based paremters to a

			  and options...
			- renamed all files to be more uniq to
			  libnsock..
			- added nsock_resolve()

			- added is_connected() for non-blocking tcp
			  connections
			  
01/10/2002	jjd	- changed version to 0.8.1
			- added *Err procedures to accomodate for
			  easier error displaying for * socket
			  functions
			- added a check for '=' preceding the hostname
			  in tcpToHost used for blocking even if
			  non-blocking is available..
			- reversed the order of this file

08/23/2001	jjd	- fixed a bug in unix_listen.c where by the
			  listen would cause a crash because of
			  modifying a hardcoded string

09/07/2001	jjd	- moved libs/nsock to a new library libsockets
			- added non_blocking connect() support for tcp
			  sockets (unfortunately the use of this must
			  be handled by the calling code)
			  
03/21/2001	jjd	- initial creation of this CHANGES file
			- put the complete version # in the directory name
			- added configure, configure.in, Makefile.in for
			  "dist" make target to use the version # in the
			  directory name
			- modified Makefile.in to accomdate for above
