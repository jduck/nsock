			- added possible error checking to
			  nsock_tcp_connected()

04/08/2002 	jjd 	- merged nsock_get_error into nsock_error for

			- switched checks for AF_UNSPEC to !AF_INET
			- fixed a bug where the alarm timeout was not

			- finished renaming to nsock_*

08/23/2001	jjd	- fixed a bug in unix_listen.c where by the
			  listen would cause a crash because of
			  modifying a hardcoded string

09/07/2001	jjd	- moved libs/nsock to a new library libsockets
			- added non_blocking connect() support for tcp

03/21/2001	jjd	- initial creation of this CHANGES file
			- put the complete version # in the directory name
