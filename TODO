- add proxy support (async?)


- possibly create some sort of accept wrapper that will deny
  connections from hosts that != nsocktcp_t.tin (semi-useless)
  - maybe support an ACL or tcp_wrappers
- would be nice to have like nsock_inet_accept_one() to get a single
  incoming connection


- async dns support?


- add more tests
  - namely unix stuff, udp, ipv6


- openssl support
  - support specifying ciphers
  - support certificate verifcation


- support non-blocking on/off around read() and write() calls


- possibly add an interface for getting/setting parts of the structure


- some multi-address dns stuff would be nice
